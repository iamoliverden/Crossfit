The Fringes of Fitness: Statistical Profiling of CrossFit Games Open Winners

M. K., Toronto, BrainStation Data Science Boot Camp, 2021

Within the scope of the project, we attempted to answer a question about how to choose the people with a winning potential.

The data used for the project related to CrossFit Games from 2019 and 2020.

To run the notebooks, use the normal Python 3 kernel.

The project includes: 

* 1_2019_open_athletes
* 2_2019_open_scores
* 3_2020_open_athletes
* 4_2020_open_scores
* The Fringes of Fitness_Statistical Profiling of CrossFit Games Open Winners

The original data set can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/jeanmidev/crossfit-games. 

The data is hundreds of mbs, and we cannot upload it together with this project. 

The notebook files should be run in order of appearance. The final code line of each of the first four notebooks should be uncommented, to allow it to create intermediary files that should be used for the final notebook.

The code can be freely used for other projects.
